rheed++ 2.0

rheed++ 2.0 is an open source software framework for the computation of RHEED intensity oscillations 
both during the growth and for the fixed surfaces of thin epitaxial layers.
The calculations are based on the one-beam approximation. 
The software does not require linking to any of the existing numerical library routines.
